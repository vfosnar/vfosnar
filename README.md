I'm moving away from GitHub. The new home for my projects is [Gitea](https://git.fosny.eu/). Any repository left here will only be a mirror, fork or something else I need for collaboration.

You can still contact me through [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@vfosnar:fosny.eu) or any other means listed on my [website](https://fosny.eu/).
